# mnist-multi-pla
This repository contains the first assignment for the Intro to Machine Learning course. The task involved extending the Perceptron Learning Algorithm (PLA) to classify digits from the MNIST dataset using a one-vs-all strategy. Specifically, the assignment utilized 10 separate perceptrons, each trained to distinguish one digit from all others.
